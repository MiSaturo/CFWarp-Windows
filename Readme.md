Must read:

1. The preferred IP port can be used for wireguard client
2. Remember, the optimal operation on each platform must be performed without an agent

The following two warp official client operation methods can be executed in any location, without dragging the file into the warp official client installation directory

Warp official client operation:

## Manual mode:
1) Open the warp official client first, make sure that the device ID has been generated and is closed
2) Double-click the "manual mode 1" file first, and generate the result.csv file after execution (the IP port can be extracted to the wireguard client)
3) Double-click the "Manual Mode 2" file, and copy the top IP port in the result.csv file to the window
4) Start the warp official client to succeed

## Automatic mode:
1) Open the warp official client first, make sure that the device ID has been generated and is closed
2) As demonstrated in the video tutorial (the automatic mode is likely to cause the protection software to warn that it is poisonous, just put the "automatic mode" file into the whitelist)
